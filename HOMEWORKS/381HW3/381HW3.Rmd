Create a short Beamer presentation (6 to 12 slides). Note that you will need to save your images to .tiff. or .jpeg or other digital formats and put them in a folder that can be linked to from your Beamer code.

Spend a bit of time exploring the different themes, colors, and fonts available in Beamer, and set up something that looks nice to you.

Your presentation should include the following:

- \color{gray}sequential bullet points
- simultaneous bullet points
- colored text
- images
- images with captions
- images with a caption overlaid (you may need to change the text color for better contrast)


## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

## Slide with one image



## Slide with two images
