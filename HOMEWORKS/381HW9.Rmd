PROBLEM 1
Using a for or while loop, write a function to calculate the number of zeroes in a numeric vector.
```{r}
# code snagged from stack overflow to create a 1,0 vector:
x <- (sample(c(0,1), replace=TRUE, size=20))
# how I would count this if I wasn't using a for loop
sum(x==0)

y<-0
# a for loop to count the number of zeros in a numeric vector:
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  if(x[i] == 0) {
  y <- y + 1
  }}
y
```
